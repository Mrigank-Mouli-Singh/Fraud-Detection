## Overview
This project implements a **fraud detection system** using machine learning on a dataset of **6.3M+ transactions**, where only ~0.13% are fraudulent.  
The goal is to build a highly accurate and interpretable model that can detect fraud in real time while providing insights into key risk factors.

## Dataset
- **Records:** ~6.36 million  
- **Features:** Transaction amount, balances, transaction type, merchant flags, timestamps, fraud label  
- **Challenge:** High class imbalance (fraud cases are only ~0.13%)

## Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- Engineered features like `deltaOrig`, `amt_to_org_bal`, log transforms, and time-based (`hour`, `day`).  
- Encoded categorical transaction types into `type_code`.  
- Created merchant and cash-out flags for better fraud detection.  

### ðŸ”¹ Handling Imbalance
- Used LightGBMâ€™s `scale_pos_weight` to balance fraud vs. non-fraud classes.  
- Optimized evaluation on **PR-AUC**, more suitable for rare-event detection.  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Training
- Algorithm: **LightGBM Gradient Boosting**  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: **Optuna (20 trials)**  
- Early stopping and regularization for robustness.  

### ðŸ”¹ Evaluation
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.9998  
- **PR-AUC:** 0.90  
- Achieved **99% recall** at threshold optimization with acceptable precision.  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Interpretability (SHAP)
- **Top features:**  
  - `amt_to_org_bal` â†’ Large proportion of transaction relative to account balance.  
  - `deltaOrig`, `oldbalanceDest` â†’ Unusual balance changes.  
  - `type_code` â†’ Transfers & Cash-outs most fraud-prone.  
- Local SHAP analysis explains individual flagged transactions.

## Business Insights

- Fraudsters often:  
  - Transfer unusually large amounts compared to available balance.  
  - Use cash-out and transfer transactions.  
  - Exploit suspicious/new merchant accounts.  

- **Recommendations:**  
  - Flag transactions where `amt_to_org_bal > 80%`.  
  - Apply stricter review for transfers & cash-outs.  
  - Profile new merchants with sudden inflows.  
  - Deploy real-time fraud scoring with human-in-the-loop review.
